## 1.1 INTRODUCTION

IIUM Sejahtera Clinic is the go-to place for every student of International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). They exist in every branch of the aforementioned institution and are well-equipped to cater to their target demographic, often placed within the campus itself. That being said, the establishment lacks a proper system to manage appointments. This has led to the clinics constantly being overwhelmed, and students who need to be tended to are not getting the care that they need.

In hopes of increasing efficiency and proactivity, our team has decided to create an appointment manager app for IIUM Sejahtera Clinic. This app will be utilised for patrons to book their meeting with the health practitioner at the branch closest to them in advance, at any time, from anywhere.



## 1.2 PROJECT OBJECTIVE

We aim to create an app that will make doctor trips less of a hassle by easing the appointment-making process. This is made so by the system within the app, which will automatically arrange it so that the patient is well-matched to the practitioner most suited for their entered concerns and is able to see them at a time most convenient to both parties, using the data from their preferred time and date. We will be able to determine whether the app has truly helped with the existing problem by making a record of appointments that are made and completed, as well as how much waiting time has been reduced, according to the system at the clinics themselves.
