**1.1 INTRODUCTION**

IIUM Sejahtera Clinic is the go-to place for every student of International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). They exist in every branch of the aforementioned institution and are well-equipped to cater to their target demographic, often placed within the campus itself. That being said, the establishment lacks a proper system to manage appointments.

In hopes of increasing efficiency and proactivity, our team has decided to create an appointment manager app for IIUM Sejahtera Clinic. This app will be utilised for patrons to book their meeting with the health practitioner at the branch closest to them in advance, at any time, from anywhere. The system will automatically arrange it so that the patient is well-matched to the practitioner most suited for their entered concerns and is able to see them at the time most convenient to both parties, using the data from their preferred time and date.
